<i>This is more of a state of tools report than proper end-user
documentation at this point</i>.
<h2>Co+op Deals</h2>
This ought to work most places. The first option, 
<i>Upload Price File</i>, just takes a co-op deals flyer saved as
a CSV. You may need to delete some of the column titles in the
first row. Multi-line values produce malformed CSVs with some
spreadsheet tools.
<p />
After uploading the CSV, you'll see a preview of the first few
rows. On this screen, select which column contains an appropriate
value. UPC and Sale Price are most important.
<p />
The other option, <i>Review &amp; create</i> lists Co+op Deals
items that exist in POS and has fields for start/end dates to
generate batches containing all the appropriate items. The main
snag is this depends on super departments. Creating a single
super department that encompasses all departments would be
sufficient to make this work (producing one big Deals batch).
<h2>Vendor Pricing</h2>
This one takes a vendor pricing CSV and updates item costs. 
Vendor spreadsheets don't conform to any sort of standard, so
there's typically a separate PHP script for each vendor (in some
cases, there may be more than one if different stores want to
import a particular catalog differently). You can choose which
script to use for a given vendor from the vendor create/edit
tool.
