IS4C/Fannie organizes items into departments. You'll need at least one, but
putting all items in a single department isn't ideal. Separating items into
departments allows better reporting options as well as data normalization
(e.g., quickly see if all items in a grouping are taxed correctly).
<p />
How you organize your items likely depends on what you sell, how your
staff is structured, and what reporting options you want. The purpose of 
this document is to explain the department options that are available
so you can design a scheme that fits your organization.
<p />
IS4C/Fannie provides three levels of granularity. <i>Super Departments</i>
contain <i>Departments</i> which in turn contain <i>Sub Departments</i>.
We're going to examine the middle tier first.
<h2>Departments</h2>
Historically, departments were the first product category provided. As a 
result, they're key to both the front and back end. Basically every tool
in IS4C/Fannie understands departments; the same is not necessarily true
of other layers that were added later to meet various stores' needs. 
<b>Departments are the only categorization that's mandatory</b>.
<p />
For the most part, departments are the only categorization the
front end understands. Transaction data is tagged by department. 
Open rings are assigned to a department. If you need to distinguish
between two types of product in any and all circumstances, put them
in separate departments.
<p />
Departments are created and edited by going to Item Maintenance =&gt;
Manage Departments in fannie's left hand menu, then <i>Manage departments</i>.
Options for a department include:
<ul>
<li><i>Name</i> that shows up in reporting and open rings</li>
<li><i>Tax</i> status. Besides affecting open rings, department-level tax
status can provide sane defaults for new products. For example, placing
water and soda in separate departments might be better than a single
beverages department if your state taxes those products differently.</li>
<li><i>Foodstamp</i> like tax, except whether an item can be purchased
with foodstamps.</li>
<li><i>Discount</i> like tax, except whether an item is included in 
transaction-level discounts (equity or gift card purchases are good examples
of departments that should not receive any discounts).</li>
<li><i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> are soft limits for open rings. Amounts outside 
the range will prompt the cashier to confirm.</li>
<li><i>Margin</i>  (table <tt>departmentMargin</tt>) is used to calculate pricing (if item cost is available)</li>
<li><i>Sales Code</i> (table <tt>departmentSalesCodes</tt>) is yet another way of grouping departments. Plug whatever
you want here to roll out custom reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Super Departments</h2>
Super Departments provide a categorization tier above departments. 
Whether you need super departments and how to arrange them depends a lot on
your staff structure. They're used primarily in back end tools to help an employee
narrow in on the group of departments they normally deal with.
They are techncially optional;
however, WFC uses them extensively and some tools may still mistakenly assume that super departments
are in use. Creating a single super department containing all your departments should alleviate
these kind of problems if you need a particular tool to work ASAP.
For example, you might want to group a number of departments as "Grocery" or "Produce".
<p />
Super Departments are created/managed by selecting Item Maintaince =&gt; Manage Departments,
then <i>Manage Super Departments</i>. Select "Create" from the drop down to make a new one,
otherwise choose the one you want to edit and add/remove departments using the arrow
buttons.
<h2>Sub Departments</h2>
Sub Departments provide a categorization tier below departments. They are also optional.
For example, you could have white/wheat/rye sub departments under a general "Bread" department.
Whether you wnat or need these is again dependent on your organization.
<p />
Sub Departments are created/managed by selecting Item Maintaince =&gt; Manage Departments,
then <i>Manage Sub Departments</i>. Choose a department from the drop down, then
add/remove sub departments as needed.
