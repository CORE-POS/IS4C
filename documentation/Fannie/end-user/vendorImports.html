This document discusses how to import spreadsheets of
vendor pricing info. 
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create Vendor(s)</h2>
To import vendor information, you need vendors.
Select Item Maintenance =&gt; <i>Manage Vendors</i>
from Fannie's left hand menu. In the drop down, choose <i>New vendor...</i>
and give the vendor a name.
<p />
You can optionally enter a vendor's department scheme
(e.g., UNFI's categories). This may be used support vendor-specific
margins. See <b>Calculating SRPs</b> below.
<p />
You can upload vendor CSVs here using the <i>Update catalog</i>
link. Custom import tools can be used to enforce special or
location-specific logic for a vendor. Custom tools are accessible
via Sales Batches =&gt; <i>Vendor Pricing</i> then choose
<i>Upload a price sheet</i>.

<h2>Step 2: Change the spreadsheet to a CSV</h2>
Very large files proces most reliably as CSV and vendor catalogs
can be very large. Open the file,
and use Save As to change the format to CSV (if you get more than
one CSV option, look for one mentioning Windows to get correct
line-endings). If the file is larger than a couple MBs, you may
need to compress it to avoid upload limits. Use the utility of your
choose to zip it.
<p />
After selecting the file, you'll see a preview of the first five
rows of data with drop down boxes to indicate what kind of data
the different columns contain. The following fields are required:
UPC, Description, Case Qty, Case Cost*. The Brand, SKU, SRP, and
Unit Size fields are optional. SRP and Cost fields may include dollar
signs. UPCs may contain spaces and dashes. If UPCs in the spreadsheet
include check digits, make sure the Remove Check Digits box is checked.
<p />
* If a vendor only provides unit cost and no case information, you
can add a column containing ones to use as Case Qty. 

<h2>Step 3: Upload the file</h2>
Select Sales Batches =&gt; <i>Vendor Pricing</i> from Fannie's left
hand menu. On the next page choose <i>Upload Price Sheet</i>. Choose
the correct vendor or custom tool, then upload your CSV
(or zipped CSV).
<p />
<i>This upload can take a long time. Like 10-15 minutes. Part of this
is weird voodoo to avoid memory/CPU limits on old hardware, and part of
it is dealing with partial pricing files. Many vendors only include
changed items in the file; updating items one at a time rather than
dumping all info and rebuilding essentially doubles execution time</i>.
