The install process creates a skeleton database. This guide will
take you through the minimaly required data population. In the process,
you'll walk through a few basic tools.
<h2>Members</h2>
IS4C and Fannie are designed around co-ops, so the idea of membership
is integral. Every transaction must be associated with a member. To start,
we're going to create a new membership type and at least one member.
<ol>
<li>Choose Admin =&gt; Member Management from fannie's left-hand menu, then
<i>Manage Member Types</i>
	<ol>
	<li>Click create a new member type. Assign a different ID number if you'd
	like, then click Create New Type</li>
	<li>Optionally, you can now edit the type your just created.
		<ul>
		<li>Description is used primarily for reporting purposes</li>
		<li>The member check box denotes whether this type of member
		should receive member-related benefits. If you sell to non-members,
		it's useful to have a default account number to associate with
		those sales (again, every transaction must be associated with
		a "member").
		<li>Discount is a percentage discount applied to an entire transaction.
		Use integer numbers - i.e., 10% = 10, not 0.10.</li>
		<li>Staff denotes an employee. Mostly for reporting currently.</li>
		<li>SSI is historically for senior citizens. I don't think it does anything
		any more</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Return to Admin =&gt; Member Management and this time choose <i>Create New Members</i>.
	<ul>
	<li>Specify what type of member you'd like to create as well as how many and 
	click Create Members</li>
	<li>Members are created in order. If you're starting from scratch and ask for
	10 new accounts, they'll be numbered one through ten.</li>
	<li>For minimal testing purposes, you'll need at least one membership.</li>
	<li>Migrating existing memberships into fannie with account numbers intact
	<b>is possible</b>, but beyond the scope of this document.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Employees</h2>
The other people involved in a transaction are cashiers. You need at least one
cashier to login and run a live transaction (a testing cashier, 9999, is built in
if you're only doing test transactions).
<ol>
<li>Select Admin =&gt; Cashier Management from fannie's left hand menu, then
<i>Add a new cashier</i>.</li>
<li>Specify a first and/or last name (note: this shows up on screen at the checkouts,
so using full names is a bad idea from a staff privacy standpoint).</li>
<li>Select privileges. The only current difference is a <i>Manager</i> can
override anyone's login (including another manager's). If someone leaves a screen
locked, forgets to sign out, or otherwise puts a lane in a weird, unworkable state,
manager-level accounts will still work.</li>
<li>If you want to change the automatically-generated password, return to
Admin =&gt; Cashier Management and choose the other option, <i>View/edit cashiers</i>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tenders</h2>
Tenders are the various forms of payments your store accepts. The simplest option
is to load up the defaults provided. You can remove ones you don't want later.
<ol>
<li>Go to the fannie configuration page (http://your-server/fannie/install/) and
click the <i>Sample Data</i> link at the top.</li>
<li>Click the <i>Load default tenders</i></li> button.</li>
</ol>
To make adjustments to your tenders, select Admin =&gt; Tenders from fannie's
left hand menu. Options are as follows:
<ul>
<li><i>Code</i> is the key sequence used to enter a tender at the front end. It's
recommended you don't edit these. Doing so may cause incompatibilities with
the mainstream front end code.</li>
<li><i>Name</i> and <i>Change Msg</i> are what will show up on screen as well
as on receipts when a tender is used.</li>
<li><i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> are soft limits for a tender type. If an entry is
outside this range, the cashier is promted to confirm the amount was not a miskey.</li>
<li><i>Type</i> and <i>Refund Limit</i> don't really do anything.</li>
</ul>
Options to add and remove tenders are at the bottom of the page.
<h2>Tax Rates</h2>
This doesn't have a menu entry yet, but the tools if found at
http://your-server/fannie/admin/TaxRates/. A "NoTax" rate is included
automatically. Add rates as decimal numbers, not percentages - e.g.,
5% sales tax is 0.05.
