Sale pricing is managed through <i>batches</i>. A batch is a
group of items and sale prices that will have sale pricing
for a pre-defined time period and conditions.
<p />
<h2>Sale Pricing</h2>
What sort of conditions? Out of the box, IS4C supports
a few kinds of sale pricing:
<ul>
<li><b>Everyone Sale</b> - the item will ring up at the specified
sale price for all customers.</li>
<li><b>Member Sale</b> - the item will ring up at the specified
sale price for members and at regular retail price for other
customers.</li>
<li><b>Percent Member Sale</b> - the item will be discounted by
the specified percentage for members. For example, entering a
sale "price" of 0.10 will make the item 10% for members. This
can be useful for longer term sales on items whose retail price
fluctuates often.</li>
<li><b>Staff Sale</b> - the item will ring up at the specified
sale price for staff and at regular retail price for other
customers. <i>This is reserved for future implementation and
may not work correctly. Test before using.</i>.
<li><b>Sliding Member Sale</b> - the item will be discounted
by the specified amount for members. A sale price of 0.10 will
reduce the price by 10 cents for members. The use case is similar
to <i>Percent Member Sale</i>.
<li><b>Case Discount Sale</b> - reserved for future implementation. 
Don't use yet.
</ul>
<p />
<h2>Batch Types</h2>
Before you can make sales batches, you need to define
a batch type or two. Batch types define the exist to
define conditions - that is, how the sale price is applied
- and for organizational purposes. You can have multiple
batch types with the same style of pricing - e.g.,
Co+op Deals as well as Public Sales - to match batches
with store signage or other internal logistics. To add,
remove, or adjust batch types click Sales Batches
on Fannie's left hand menu, then <i>Manage Batch types</i>.
Note edits are saved automatically.
<h2>Creating a Sales Batch</h2>
With batch types in place, you can create a sales batch.
Go to Sales Batches in Fannie's left hand menu,
then select the menu option <i>Sales Batches</i>. At the
top of this page are fields to create a new batch. The
remainder of the page lists existing batches. You can view
all batches, pending batches (haven't happened yet), current
batches (on sale now), or historical batches (done &amp; over).
<p />
Batches can be tagged and filtered by owner. This feature is
dependent on super departments. It's also optional, so feel
free to ignore it.
<p />
To create a new batch, select a type at the top and plug 
in a name for the batch, a start date, and an end date, then
click the Add button. This simply adds a new batch to the list
below.
<p />
To add item to your batch, click on the batch's name. To
make any alterations to the batch type, name, or dates, click
the edit/pencil icon. To delete a batch, click the red X icon.
<p />
Clicking a batch's name goes to the item level view. From here,
you can add, remove, or re-price items in a batch. First, enter
a UPC and click add (or press enter). If the item is found, its
description and regular price are displayed with a field
for sale price. Plug in a sale price and hit enter again. Tip:
if you miskeyed the UPC, just leave sale price blank and hit enter
to start over.
<p />
The list of items in the batch is editable in a similar manner to
the list of batches. Click the red X to remove an item from the
batch or the pencil icon to edit the sale price. When editing,
sale prices are expressed as two numbers, e.g. 1 for $1.99. You can
use this to set up quantity-specific sales like 3-for-$1; this option
is omited from the default "add item" interface simply because
it's not used very often.
<p />
The last option of note in the item view is <i>Force Batch</i>. Typically
sale pricing is applied on the start date during normal nightly
database tasks. If you need an item on sale <b>immediately</b> - for
instance, if a new item was just added to a live sale - this option
will re-price all items in the batch.
<h2>Price Change Batches</h2>
Price change batches are similar to sales batches - they consist
of a group of items and alternate prices, but rather than applying
a sale price to items, these batches alter the items' regular price.
Add and print shelftag options are used mainly with price change
batches. The general idea is to get new signage ready for a group
of items, then push new prices with the <i>Force Batch</i> option.
<h2>Intentionally Left Out (for now)</h2>
A couple links and options aren't covered above. What/why:
<ol>
	<li>Likecodes are groups of items with different UPCs that
		POS considers identical (think produce). The concept
		itself isn't well documented yet, but in the batch
		context they're just an alternative to entering
		items by upc.</li>
	<li>Add limit puts a cap on sale prices per transaction
	i.e., one per customer. This was used for some one-time WFC
	promotions and I'm not 100% sure it still works. Probably does,
	but test it first.</li>
	<li>The <i>Cut</i> option next to items removes an item from a batch
		and stores it on a background "clipboard". If there
		are items on your clipboard, you can paste them into
		another batch. Each user gets their own clipboard, but
		authentication needs to be turned on for that to
		work.</li>	
</ol>
