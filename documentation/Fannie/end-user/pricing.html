This is the master list of product and price related
management. We're going to reference the <b>price change
page</b> a whole lot, so to get there:
<i>Click Item Maintenance in Fannie's left hand menu</i>.
<h1>How do I add an item to POS?</h1>
Go to the price change page. Enter your item's UPC. Leading
zeroes are not necessary. At minimum, enter a
<i>description</i> and <i>price</i>, then select a <i>Dept</i>
(department). All other fields are optional. Click
<i>Create Item</i>. Tax and
foodstamp status is assigned automatically based on department.
<hr />
<h1>How do I add two items with the same UPC?</h1>
This is not allowed. 
<hr />
<h1>How do I change an item's price?</h1>
Go to the price change page. Enter your item's UPC. Alter
the <i>Price</i> field. Click <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>How do I find an item without the UPC?</h1>
Go to the price change page. Enter part of the item's
description. This will list all item's with a matching
description. Click on the one that you want. If only one
item has that description, it'll skip straight to editing
that item.
<hr />
<h1>Why isn't my item the same price at all lanes?</h1>
There are a few possibilities. First, go to the price
change page and look up the item. Now scroll down to
the <i>Lane Status</i> section.
<ul>
<li>If some or all of your lanes aren't listed here,
they need to be added to Fannie's configuration. Do so,
or contact the IT staff in charge of doing so, then revisit
this guide.</li>
<li>If <i>can't connect</i> messages show up for some
or all of the lanes, there's a configuration error or
network problem. Contact the staff in charge of fixing that,
then revisit this guide.</li>
<li>If all lanes show prices for the item, just not
the correct prices, just click <i>Update Item</i>. This will
update all lane prices. If one of the two issues above
was not the problem, perhaps notify IT so they can
determine where prices got out of sync.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1>Why does the item I entered say "not found" at the lanes</h1>
First look up the item on the price change page and scroll
down to the lane section. If any lanes are missing or show
incorrect information, see the above question <i>why isn't
my item the same price at all lanes</i> to resolve problems,
then click <i>Update Item</i> to re-send it to the lanes.
<p />
If lane status appears correct, the next mostly likely issue
is check digits (or lack thereof). Write down the exact
UPC shown on the lane's <i>item not found</i> error. The item
must be entered with this exact UPC. If your scanner includes
check digits, include check digits in Fannie. If your scanner
omits check digits, omit them in Fannie. EAN-style barcodes
cause the most problems here as the check digit is harder
to identify.
<hr />
<h1>Why does an item ring up with "w/ volume adjust" messages?</h1>
A volume price scheme may have been added accidentially.
Look up the item on the price change page. Click the <i>Price</i>
drop down and choose <i>Volume Price</i>. Delete any entries here
and uncheck the checkbox, then click <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>How do I put an item on sale?</h1>
Create a sales batch and add the item, or simply add it to an
existing batch. If it needs to go on sale immediately, use the
<i>Force Batch</i> option. See <a href="batches.html">Sales Batches</a>
for more details.
<hr />
<h1>How do I take an item off sale?</h1>
First look up the item on the price change page. Examine the green
<i>Sale Price</i> row to find out which batch the item is in. Then
go to that batch and delete the item. You may need to return to the
price change page and re-submit the item to make the change
immediate.
<hr />
<h1>Why does an item show a message about not being for sale?</h1>
It's likely not marked <i>InUse</i>. It's a soft error that cashiers
can bypass, but to remove the warning look up the item on the
price change page, check <i>InUse</i> under <i>Extra Info</i>, then
click <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>Why is the lane saying "place item on scale"?</h1>
The item is marked as sold by weight. Look up the item on the price change
page, then uncheck the <i>Scale</i> box and <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>Why isn't the lane weighing an item?</h1>
The item is not marked as sold by weight. Look up the item on the price change
page, then check the <i>Scale</i> box and <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>How do I enter variable-weight, pre-stickered items such as from a Hobart deli scale?</h1>
First, set your scale to use UPC prefix "2" and include the price in the UPC
rather than the weight. This is generally the default anyway. Now, examing a sticker
UPC, the first digit should be 2. The next <i>five</i> digits are the item number,
and the <i>five</i> digits after that are the price. Last is the check digit (note:
if you're not omitting check digits, this feature probably doesn't work). Go
to the price change page. Enter the first <i>six</i> digits of the the sticker UPC
followed by <i>five</i> zeroes. For example, an item with sticker UPC
21234500199 (plus check digit) should be entered as 21234500000. Entering a price
is largely optional, but otherwise the settings work like any other item.
<hr />
<h1>How do I put a variable-weight, pre-stickered item on sale?</h1>
If the item is stickered by count rather than by weight, just enter it into
a sales batch normally, with the UPC adjusted as listed in the above question.
<p />
If the item is stickered by weight, you need to make a couple adjustments.
Look up the item on the price change page. Make sure the price field is set to
the item's regular, non-sale price. This is used at check-out time to calculate
how much the item weighs which affects sale price. Also make sure the <i>Scale</i>
box is checked. With these two settings correct, click <i>Update Item</i>, then
go add the appropriate UPC and sale price-per-weight in a sales batch.
<hr />
<h1>How do I ensure an item is not discounted?</h1>
If you use transaction-level discounts, like 5% off an entire transaction, some items
may need to be included such as loss-leaders, gift cards, or equity. To exclude an
item from this type of discount, look it up on the price change page and
check the <i>NoDisc</i> box. Then <i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>How do I require the cashier to enter a quantity for an item?</h1>
This feature is typically used with product PLUs that aren't weighed. Look up the
item on the price change page, then check the <i>QtyFrc</i> box. Click
<i>Update Item</i>.
<hr />
<h1>How do I pull price updates from a spreadsheet my vendor sent?</h1>
<a href="vendorImports.html">That needs a longer answer</a>.
