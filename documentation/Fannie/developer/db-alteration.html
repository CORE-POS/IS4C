Occasionally a developer may wish to change an existing table
or view. This has the potential to be more disruptive to other
users, so the process is a bit different and requires confirmation
rather than being automated.
<p />
Updates are made using BasicModels. The BasicModel.php file can be used
as a command line script. To generate a skeleton model for a table, run
<pre>
php BasicModel.php --name TableName
</pre>
To generate the getter / setter functions, run
<pre>
php BasicModel.php TableNameModel.php
</pre>
<p />
To add a new column, simply define it in the array of columns then re-run
the command to generate getters and setters. To rename a column, specify
the name of the column it replaces in the definition. No other alterations
are support by the base class but you can define your own normalize() 
method for other changes.
<p />
If a method exists named 'hookAddColumnNAME' (where NAME is the name of the
new column), that method will be called after creating the column. This can
be used to populate data into that column.
<p />
Every effort should be made to avoid creating SQL errors in code by
changing the database. INSERTs are the most common problem. Using model classes
to write records can simplify this otherwise manually checking whether a 
column exists can work too. Put a <b>dated</b> comment near this kind of code
to give an indication when the schema changed.
