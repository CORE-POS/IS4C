All database interactions are conducted via the SQLManager class. A full list of its
methods is beyond the scope of this document, but its primary purpose is to allow
for different DBMSes (e.g., MySQL, Postgres, etc) without altering PHP code. In general,
its methods correspond to PHP's MySQL functions with the "mysql_" removed (e.g., <i>query()</i>,
<i>fetch_row()</i>, <i>num_rows()</i>, <i>error()</i>, etc). Learning all the classes' methods
is encouraged but probably overkill when just getting started.

<p>
Request a database connection via the FannieDB class. It contains a static method, <i>get($db_name [string])</i>
where $db_name is the name of a database. The global configuration variables $FANNIE_OP_DB, $FANNIE_TRANS_DB,
and $FANNIE_ARCHIVE_DB contain the names of Fannie's three default databases. These are user-customizable so
don't hardcode common defaults like "core_op" or "is4c_trans".

<p>
If your plugin needs additional tables and/or views, include a database name option in the plugins' settings
so the user has the option of keeping the plugins' tables/views in a separate database. This reduces the
chances of running into name problems where two plugins want to use the same name for a table/view and makes
it easier for the user to manage data related to the plugin. Deleting tables or views when the plugin is
disabled is generally a bad idea unless that data can be easily recreated. Losing data due to a mistaken
configuration change is bad. Clearly keeping the plugins' tables/views separate makes it more reasonable
for the user to decide what is safe to manually delete.
