<h1>Defining a Plugin</h1>
    <div style="border: solid 1px black; font-size: 115%; padding: 1em;">
    The latest documentation can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C/wiki/Writing-Fannie-Plugins">Project Wiki</a>.
    The information below may be out of date. 
    </div>
<p>
User-defined plugins go in <i>modules/plugins2.0</i>. To get started, make a new
directory there. This will contain your plugin. Inside that directory create a
new PHP file to define your plugin. This definition tells Fannie a little information
about your plugin. To do so, it needs to define a class extending FanniePlugin like this:
</p>
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
include_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../../config.php');
</pre>
<p>
This line includes Fannie's global configuration file. It's almost always a good idea
to do this first so all user-defined settings are accessible. Note that the path does not
assume Fannie is in a particular directory like /var/www. This is important for compatibility
with various systems. Using "dirname(__FILE__)" is preferred over using "__DIR__" since
the latter is only available in relatively new versions of PHP.
</p>
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
if (!class_exists('FanniePlugin')) include($FANNIE_ROOT.'classlib2.0/FanniePlugin.php');
</pre>
<p>
This line includes the definition for the base class FanniePlugin. The variable $FANNIE_ROOT
is provided by Fannie's global configuration file. It points to the directory containing Fannie
and can be used to reference paths without using lots of "../" strings.
</p>
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
class CalendarPlugin extends FanniePlugin {
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, define the plugin class. The name of the subclass should match the name of the PHP file.
So, for example, in this case the file should be named CalendarPlugin.php. As a best practice, this
applies to any PHP file that defines a class.
</p>
<h1>Further Options</h1>
At this point, the plugin definition is technically complete. Possible additions include:
<ul>
<li>A description of your plugin is generally a good idea.
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
public $plugin_description = 'Plugin for calendars';
</pre>
<li>If your plugin has any user-configurable settings, you can define them in the
settings array. Each setting needs a name, default value, description, and label.
Settings will be saved in the global configuration variable $FANNIE_PLUGIN_SETTINGS 
via the name key. An example setting like this:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
public $plugin_settings = array(
'CalendarDatabase' => array('default'=>'core_calendar','label'=>'Database',
		'description'=>'Database to calendars. Can
				be one of the default CORE databases or a 
				separate one.')
);
</pre>
would be saved as $FANNIE_PLUGIN_SETTINGS['CalendarDatabase'].
<li>Define triggers. The FanniePlugin class includes methods
named <i>plugin_enable()</i>, <i>plugin_disable()</i>, and
<i>setting_change()</i>. These are called when the plugin
is enabled, disabled, or its settings are updated (respectively).
</ul>
