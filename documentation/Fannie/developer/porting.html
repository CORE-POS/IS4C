<h1>Porting Existing Code Into Fannie</h1>

    The latest documentation can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C/wiki/Porting-Existing-IS4C-Code-to-Fannie">Project Wiki</a>.

Got something that already works and what to start integrating
it into Fannie? Great! Get started here. There are a few key
tasks to make your code get along with Fannie and behave nicely
for others as well as your self.
<ul>
<li>Interact with the configuration file</li>
<li>Avoid absolute paths</li>
<li>Access the database</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interact with the configuration file</h3>
Fannie provides a global configuration file for storing settings.
It lives in the root directory and is aptly named config.php.
Including this file is almost always the first thing you should
do in a script. It defines a bunch of helpful global variables.
<h3>Avoid absolute paths</h3>
Since Fannie is meant to exist at many locations with various
configurations, we cannot make any assumptions about file
paths. If your code is in /var/www/fannie/my-new-feature/index.php,
don't write this:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
include('/var/www/fannie/config.php');
</pre>
That's not portable. If someone else tries to use this code
and they have fannie in a different directory, it won't work.
Either of these options would work as an alternative:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
include('../config.php');
include(dirname(__FILE__).'/../config.php');
</pre>
The second option is slightly less likely to cause path problems
but either will work in most cases. You can use a similar notation
for further includes or use the variable $FANNIE_ROOT that's defined
in config.php and contains the filesystem path for fannie's top
directory. Similarly, the variable $FANNIE_URL provides a URL for
fannie's top directory.
<h3>Access the Database</h3>
There are a couple ways to connect to the database. The recommended
way is using objects.
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
include($FANNIE_ROOT.'classlib2.0/data/FannieDB.php);
$dbc = FannieDB::get($FANNIE_OP_DB);
</pre>
The older way, at least in some versions of Fannie, still exists too.
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
include($FANNIE_ROOT.'src/mysql_connect.php');
</pre>
This include file also provides a similar variable named <b>$dbc</b>.
<p>
One important thing to note is that <b>$dbc</b> is not a mysql connection
resource; it's an instance of the SQLManager class. In a lot of cases that
won't matter yet, but if you're passing the optional connection argument to
mysql functions they may object. For example:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
mysql_query($someQuery, $dbc); // may cause error
mysql_query($someQuery);       // should work
</pre>
</p>
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
Hopefully at this point your feature works (or mostly works). What should you do
next? These are a few options:
<ul>
<li>Use the SQLManager class</li>
<li>Add your own settings to Fannie's configuration</li>
<li>Use Fannie's look &amp; feel on your pages</li>
</ul>
</body>
<h3>Use the SQLManager class</h3>
<p>
The SQLManager class is a layer between Fannie and the database. Its primary purpose
is to prevent database-specific function calls and query syntax as much as possible.
If anyone ever wants or needs to run Fannie on something other than MySQL this makes
the process a lot easier. It also enables some nifty tricks like unified logging of 
all failed queries and prepared statements and transfering data between different
hosts.
</p>
<p>
The biggest task here is to convert mysql_* functions. This is usually pretty easy
since SQLManager's method names are based on the mysql_* functions. Just remove
"mysql_" like this:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
mysql_query($someQuery);
$dbc->query($someQuery);

mysql_num_rows($result);
$dbc->num_rows($result);

mysql_fetch_row($result);
$dbc->fetch_row($result);
</pre>
Often you can just use find and replace in your editor
to change all instances of "mysql_" to "$dbc-&gt;". One
potential issue to be aware of is you have to keep track
of the connection object. If you have a query inside a function,
you need to pass it <b>$dbc</b> or use the global keyword
to get access to it.
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
function updateV1($dbc){
	$dbc->query($someQuery);
}
// or
function updateV2(){
	global $dbc;
	$dbc->query($someQuery);
}
</pre>
</p>
<h1>Add your own settings to Fannie's configuration</h1>
If your feature has (or needs) user configurable settings,
you can add them by writing a plugin class
(<a href="plugins/define-a-plugin.html">details</a>).
You don't have to do anything special to the rest of your
files. This is just the easiest to define your settings
and hook into the web interface without mucking around in
some fairly ugly code.
<h1>Use Fannie's look &amp; feel on your pages</h1>
Like accessing the database, there are two ways to
add Fannie's header, footer, and menu to your page(s):
an object-oriented way and the old way. The
<a href="plugins/page.phps">object-oriented way</a> is
very structured for consistency and its subclasses can
automatically provide a bunch of functionality for
certain tasks (e.g., generating a report or uploading a
file). The traditional way is quicker and there's no API
to learn:
<pre style="background:#ccc; padding:3px;">
$header = 'My Page Header';
$page_title = 'My Window Title';
include($FANNIE_ROOT.'src/header.html');

/*
All your code for printing
*/

include($FANNIE_ROOT.'src/footer.html');
</pre>
</html>
