	Want to just start shoe-horning the tools you need into this structure? Here's the anatomy of a PHP tool under fannie. You'll need to add one to four lines to an existing tool. I know, demanding.
	<h3>Grab the config</h3>
	The first thing every script should do is include config.php. This gives you a variable named $FANNIE_ROOT that is the absolute path to the top of fannie. Any other files you need can be included using this variable.
	<h3>Need a database connection?</h3>
	If you need a database connection, include $FANNIE_ROOT."src/mysql_connect.php". The name is historic; it works with mssql too. This include brings in a variable named $dbc. $dbc is <b>not</b> a mysql resource; it's a class wrapped around ADOdb for multiple dbms support. If you want to use this class, it's pretty intuitive. $dbc->query is equivalent to mysql_query, $dbc->num_rows is equivalent to mysql_num_rows, etc. 
	<h3>Want a skin</h3>
	If you want the "outer frame" of fannie with menu, include two more files: $FANNIE_ROOT."src/header.html" and $FANNIE_ROOT."src/footer.html". It's optional. I don't always use it when I want the full screen width.
