	The recommended way to extend or alter CORE's functionality is via plugins.
	Documentation on other functionality is available as well but plugin 
	developers should not rely too heavily on it. The plugin API is meant to be
	quite stable but the underlying functionality behind the API may be subject
	to change.
	<p>
	Stores already running some version of Fannie may want to start with
	the Porting documentation. It's more of a step by step approach that
	makes sense when you already have a bunch of code as opposed to someone
	who's starting from scratch.
