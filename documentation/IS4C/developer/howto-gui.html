	The classes in gui-class-lib provide a structured way to draw screen output.
	All subclasses follow a nearly identical path; the variations on BasicPage
	just automatically fill in some common variations.
	<h3>How a page is generated</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>The preprocess() method is called. If the return is False, nothing is
	drawn. Preprocess is typically used to deal with session and/or form data,
	and to redirect to other pages when applicable. Setting headers to redirect
	is really the only reason I can think of to return false.</li>
	<li>Doctype, html and head tags, the default css, and jquery are all
	output automatically, then head_content() is called. If a store.css file is
	present, it will also be included <i>after</i> the default pos.css.
	Use head_content() to add more javascript or custom CSS.</li>
	<li>A closing head tag and opening body tag are output, then body_content()
	is called. Print the main contents here.</li>
	<li>Closing tags are added and all javascript specified by calls to the
	add_onload_commands() method are called. These stack; you can call 
	add_onload_commands() multiple times to execute multiple actions on page-load.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Variants</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>InputPage</b> - this variant includes an input box at the top of the screen, similar to
	input.php in the framed version of IS4C, and includes the totals footer. The input form's action
	is PHP_SELF. If you need a different action, use BasicPage and call the input_header() method
	manually. It accepts an optional "action" argument.</li>
	<li><b>NoInputPage</b> - this variant omits the input box but still has time and standalone
	status, similar to noinput.php in the framed version of IS4C. It also includes the totals
	footer.</li>
	<li><b>PaycardProcessPage</b> - this variant includes some extra javascript functions that
	are useful for submitting paycard requests via AJAX calls.</li>
	</ul>
	</body>
