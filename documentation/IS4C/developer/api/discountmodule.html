DiscountModules calculate transaction-level discounts. The default
behavior is to multiply items with discountable=1 by the percentage
in custdata's Discount column. Subclasses may provide an entirely
different calculation if necessary. The <b>percentage</b> function
lets you apply a different value than custdata.Discount to the
transaction. The <b>calculate</b> function allows for more involved
changes such as apply different percentages to different items.
In general, <b>percentage</b> is a safer choice in that it's less
likely to result in odd edge cases.
</p>
<blockquote>
double <b>calculate</b>()<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
The return value should be the current discount based on the
transaction's state. This value is normally positive.
</p>
<blockquote>
double <b>percentage</b>(double $custdata_discount)<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
The return value is the discount the customer should receive.
The <b>$custdata_discount</b> argument is the value
from custdata.Discount. Both the parameter and return value
are expressed as percentages: i.e., 5.0 means a 5% discount.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example</b>: give members an extra 5% discount on 
Wednesdays
<pre>
class WednesdayDiscount extends DiscountModule {
	function percentage($custdata_discount=0){
		// Not a Wednesday or not a member
		if (date('w') != 3 || $CORE_LOCAL->get('isMember') != 1)
			return $custdata_discount;
		else
			return $custdata_discount + 5;
	}
}
</pre>
