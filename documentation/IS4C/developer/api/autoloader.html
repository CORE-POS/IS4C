The AutoLoader is the backbone of the POS module system.
It's responsible for discovering and including all the
available modules. There are a few things to be aware of
when interacting with this system:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The name of your module's class <b>must</b> match the file's name. If
	you create a class named <b>MyNewModule</b> it needs to go in a file named
	<b>MyNewModule.php</b>. The AutoLoader will not find the module correctly
	if the class and file names do not correspond.</li>
	<li>Modules are identified via inheritence. If your module's class does not
	<b>extend</b> one of the base module AutoLoader won't find it.</li>
	<li>Modules located inside plugins are only loaded if that plugin is enabled.</li>
	<li>AutoLoader::ListModules($base_class) will return a list of all modules that
	implement a specified base class. This list is ordered such that all
	plugin-provided modules are at the front of the list before any of the modules
	that are included by default. Plugins can often use this fact to override
	default behavior.</li>
</ul>
