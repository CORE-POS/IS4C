NewMagellan is one of the scale drivers included in this release.
It works to connect IS4C to a Magellan scanner/scale, but it also
serves as a base point for communicating with multiple external
devices.
<p />
NewMagellan is written in C# .NET. All traces of winforms have been
stripped out for the sake of mono compatibility. It doesn't require
Visual Studio on Windows; the .NET 2 SDK includes a command line that's
sufficient. Both a makefile for linux and a batch file for compiling
on windows included.
<p />
<b>How it works</b>
<p />
Magellan reads ports.conf to see what drivers to use. Entries are just
a port (COM1, /dev/Stty1, etc) and a driver name (e.g., SPH_Magellan_Scale).
You can have more than one driver running - say a scanner/scale
and a signature capture device.
<p />
Each driver is launched in its own thread. Other than implementing the
SerialPortHandler class, there's no hard and fast requirements what a driver
actually has to do. Reading from the relevant serial port would probably
be the most common. Writing to the file system is the easiest way I've found
to pass info to IS4C (similar to what ssd does).
<p />
After starting all the drivers, Magellan launches one more thread with
a simple UDP server. All it does is listen (port 9450 by default) and
pass any received messages to each driver. This way IS4C can send
commands to devices directly without intermediary files.
<p />
The current version accepts command line input of messages, too. Writing
an init script to background the process is left as an excercise for
the sysadmin on linux (or when I get around to it). The windows version
compiles a second executable that can be registered as a windows service.
<p />
Win32 service notes: the port/driver configuration is hard-coded into
the executable, so you have to recompile to make changes (alternately you
could hard-code the path to ports.conf, but that would mean a recompile
too). The .NET SDK includes a utility called installutil.exe. To install,
run installutil.exe posSVC.exe. To remove, run installutil.exe /u posSVC.exe.
Installation prompts for a username and password. The username has to 
include the machine name (e.g., POS1\is4c_user) to work. It took me awhile
to figure that out.
