	Installing IS4C is supposed to be easy.
	<ol>
		<li>Drop it on a webserver</li>
		<li>Navigate to the install directory with a browser
		<ul>
			<li>The install script tries to write the configuration file, ini.php. It'll tell you what the web server's uid is and whether or not the config file is writable. If it isn't, you need to fix that.</li>
			<li>Once you plug in your database connection values, the install script creates all the tables and views it needs (in theory).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>There is no step 3</li>
	</ol>
	<hr />
	If you're pointing IS4C at an pre-existing database, you're probably ready to go.
	Otherwise, sample data is provided and can be loaded from the install script.
