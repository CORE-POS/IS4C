<h1>Creating new reports</h1>
Eventually a time will come when you need a different sort
of report beyond what Fannie provides out of the box. If that
time comes <em>before</em> you've learned any PHP and/or HTML,
that's okay. Glance over the table &amp; view docs if needed and
get somebody who speaks SQL. Yourself, another staffer, a kidnapped
consultant, whatever.
<p />
Head over to Fannie's <a href="../../../fannie/reports/DBA/">report generator</a>
(fannie/reports/DBA/ if you're reading this elsewhere). Put your query in the
big box. There's some keyword scrubbing to prevent you from shooting yourself in the
foot, but don't go <em>trying</em> to create a disaster. 
If you're querying transaction data and you provide dates (or just a
start date), the tool will automatically replace <i>dlog</i> and/or <i>dtransactions</i>
with appropriate references to the archive structure. This is entirely optional; you
can type references to archive tables and views manually, too.
<p />
Default output is a webpage. Check the download results box to get a spreadsheet
instead. Some newer versions of Excel complain that the file isn't really in
correct XLS format, but they can still open it.
<p />
If you're going to run a report often, you can save it by putting a name in the
<i>Save As</i> field.
