Fannie includes a default task for creating MySQL database
backups. For other database systems, you're on your own.
This document is tailored towards MySQL in a Linux/UNIX
environment. Making it work in Windows should be possible though.
<h1>Backup Basics</h1>
Nothing overly fancy is going on here. Backups are performed using
mysqldump. The main advantage is utilizing fannie's configuration
so there's one <i>master</i> file with database connection info
that all tools and scripts rely on. If you rotate database passwords
periodically, that means just one file to update.
<h1>Configuration</h1>
Fannie's main install/config page exposes a few configuration options
for database backups:
<ul>
	<li><i>Path to backups</i> is where to store the backups. Each
	database (default is4c_op, is4c_trans, &amp; trans_archve) is
	given its own subdirectory here. This path should be writeable
	and of course have adequate free space</li>
	<li><i>Path to mysqldump</i> is your system directory for mysql-related
	programs. The default, /usr/bin/, should be fine on most systems. Some
	systems given cron a very limited shell, so full paths with binaries
	provide some error-proofing.</li>
	<li><i>Number of backups</i> is how many backups, per database, to
	store. Backups are named with a date stamp (e.g., is4c_opYYYYMMDD.sql).
	When the number of existing backups exceeds this setting, the oldest
	one(s) are deleted.</li>
	<li><i>Compress backups</i> is optional. Turning this one just passes
	the backup through gzip. The normal mysql dumps are plain text, so
	space savings from compression are pretty significant. For very large
	databases, the CPU overhead of compression is also significant though.
	For multi-GB databses, a bigger disk may be a better solution.</li>
</ul>
Once the configuration is set, just enable and schedule the job
<b>nightly.db.backup.php</b> via Fannie Dayend Polling =&gt; Scheduled Tasks.
<h1>Restoring a Backup</h1>
First, if you used compression, decompress the desired backup file. In most
graphical environments, that's just double-clicking it. On the command line,
try <i>gzip -d &lt;backup file&gt;</i>.
<p />
Next, load the backup file. If you're using any sort of GUI tool to manage
your MySQL server, just find it's backup/restore option and restore from your
backup file. The format's pretty universal, so any tool should handle it. Working
on the command line, try <i>mysql -u &lt;mysql username&gt; -p &lt;mysql password&gt;
-h &lt;mysql host IP&gt; &lt; &lt;backup file&gt;</i>. Example for clarity:
<i>mysql -u root -p secret_passcode -h localhost &lt; is4c_op20120101.sql</i>.
