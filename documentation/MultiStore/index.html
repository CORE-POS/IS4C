<h2>Architecture</h2>
Each store has its own IS4C server. This server is responsible for
managing that store's lanes. One server may be denoted the <i>Master</i>
server. Functionally, all servers have the same software. The Master
server just gets to wear a special hat.
<p />
The advantages of having what's basically a two tier system despite
three obvious tiers (lane, store server, master organization-wide server)
are flexibility in provisioning and robustness in the event of failure.
<p />
A two store operation could purchase two store servers, one for each store,
and simply denote on of them master. Alternatively, they could purchase
three store servers, one for each store and a third with no actual lanes of
its own to act as master. In the two store, three server set up, the 
organization can temporarily cope with any single hardware failure with simple configuration
changes; there's no additional software to install.
<h2>Configuration</h2>
There's a <i>Stores</i> link at the top of Fannie's configuration. Each store server
has its own copy of Fannie and own unique configuration file. Configuration for each
server is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Enter the number of other stores and re-run to expose additional fields. Remember,
a dedicated master server counts as a store, too.</li>
<li>Enter databse connection information for the other stores. Technically, only the
master store needs to know about all stores; the other stores just need to know how
to reach the master.</li>
<li>Mark which store server is the Master.</li>
<li>Enter the name of the archive database for the Master server.</li>
<li>Hit re-run again to save additional configuration.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Store =&gt; Master Transaction Info</h2>
Since the Master Store is functionally identical to other stores, transaction data
is archived in the same way. Snapshot tables exist for each month and the transarchive
table holds the previous 90 days. If the master server is a dedicated machine with
no lanes, dtransactions will simply be empty. See DBA docs for more info on transaction
archive structure.
<p />
The provided cron script <b>nightly.hq.dtrans.php</b> will transfer transaction data from a store
to the master database. First it creates a temporary table on the master server. This table
is named based on the store's IP. If multiple stores are sending data to master simultaneously
<i>and</i> different store servers have the same IP, this could go haywire. Give your store servers
different IPs. The store then copies its dtransactions to the temporary table on master.
<p />
Next the script copies data from the temporary table into transarchive and the appropriate monthly
snapshot. Finally it drops the temporary table. Overall, using a temporary table should be slightly
faster since data only goes over the network once. The extra, unique table also simplifies concurrency
issues if multiple stores are submitting transaction data to master simultaneously.
<p />
Misc: this job should happen <b>before</b> the store's local transaction archiving, or dtransactions
will be empty. This also copies data one record at a time to accomodate WFC's mess of a
store server on SQL Server + Windows and a master server on MySQL + OS X (and the Apache side of
Fannie on CentOS for maximum platform inconsistency... er platform independence...). Piping
mysqldump would probably be faster if all machines are MySQL, but current performance is
still only 30-40 seconds, tops.
<h2>Syncing Operational Data</h2>
Manual syncing is accessible from Fannie. Click <i>Synchronize</i>, then <i>Synch Stores</i>.
Options depend on whether you're at the master store. You can send a table:
<ul>
<li>From master to all other stores</li>
<li>From master to a single store</li>
<li>From a regular store to the master store</li>
</ul>
This tool <b>replaces</b> data at the destination store(s) rather than adds to it.
