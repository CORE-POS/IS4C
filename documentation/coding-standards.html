    The information below may be out of date. 
    </div>
<h1>PHP Standards</h1>
CORE generally follows the style guidelines for the
<a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">PHP Framework Interop Group</a>.
New code should follow the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/">PSR-1</a>
coding standard and the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2</a>
style guide. There are two exceptions of note:
<ol>
    <li>CORE <b>does</b> use class autoloading, but <b>does not</b> currently
    use namespaces or underscores to define directory paths. File names should
    still match class names and be case-sensitive - e.g., class <i>Foo</i> should
    be defined in a file named <i>Foo.php</i>.</li>
    <li>PSR-1 says <i>Files SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) 
    or cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both</i>.
    CORE files <b>should not</b> cause side effects at all when include()ed; side effects
    should only occur when files are directly executed. This aids in class autodiscovery.
    Typically one of these constructs used:
    <pre style="border: solid 1px black; background: #ccc; padding: 1em;">
if (dirname(__FILE__) == dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) {
    // means file is being executed
    // side effects code goes here
}

// OR EQUIVALENTLY

FannieDispatch::conditionalExec();
    </pre>
</ol>
<h1>SQL Standards</h1>
<ol><li><b>Naming Things</b>:
<ul>
    <li>New tables and views should be named in StudlyCaps. Names should be plural
    unless there is a specific logical reason for a singular name.</li>
    <li>Column names should be in camelCase.</li>
    <li>All tables should contain an incrementing integer column named tableNameID.
    The camelCase rule applies and these columns should be singular unless, again,
    there is a specific logical reason for using plural. For example, a table named
    <i>Members</i> would have increment column <i>memberID</i>.</li>
    <li>All tables should contain a primary key. The primary key may be the incrementing
    integer column but does not have to be if another column has a more important
    uniqueness contraint. Single column primary keys are preferred</li>
    <li>Foreign key columns should exactly match the column name in the relevant table.</li>
    <li>Exceptions:<ul>
        <li>New columns added to an existing table should follow the naming style
        present in that table. If existing columns are lowercase_underscore, new
        columns should be the same. If there is no rhyme or reason to the existing
        column names, use camelCase.</li>
        <li>Abbreviations and acronyms are generally capitalized - e.g., memberID
        instead of memberId - but if they occur in the middle of a name
        use whatever capitalization pattern is most readable.</li>
        <li>Multiple foreign keys to the same column can be named in any reasonably
        logical manner.</li>
        <li>If a new table has a foreign key to an older table where the older
        table <b>does not</b> have proper camelCase column names, the new table
        should use a camelCase name rather than an exactly matching name. For example,
        NewTable.departmentID corresponds to departments.dept_no rather than
        continuing to spread misformatted names through the schema.
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Writing Queries</b>:
<ul>
    <li>SQL reserved words and function names should be CAPITALIZED.</li>
    <li>SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY lines should all be
    on new lines at the same indent level.</li>
    <li>At most one column or conditional may be included on the same line
    as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY.</li>
    <li>Additional columns, conditionals, and joins should be indented
    on further level with one column, conditional, or join per line.
    <li>JOIN and ON should go on the same line.</li>
    <li>Very long column, conditional, or join lines should be split
    and indented so as to be readable.
    <li>Commas go on the end of lines</li>
    <li>ANDs and ORs go at the beginning of lines</li>
    <li>Example queries:
    <pre style="border: solid 1px black; background: #ccc; padding: 1em;">
SELECT d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name,
    COUNT(p.upc) AS numProducts
FROM products AS p
    LEFT JOIN departments AS d ON p.department=d.dept_name
WHERE p.upc LIKE '0000000%'
    AND d.department < 500
GROUP BY d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name
HAVING COUNT(p.upc) <> 0
ORDER BY d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name

SELECT
    d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name,
    COUNT(p.upc) AS numProducts
FROM 
    products AS p
    LEFT JOIN departments AS d ON p.department=d.dept_name
WHERE 
    p.upc LIKE '0000000%'
    AND d.department < 500
GROUP BY 
    d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(p.upc) <> 0
ORDER BY 
    d.dept_no,
    d.dept_name
    </pre>
    <li>User input <b>should</b> be handled via prepared statements in lane code.
    User input <b>must</b> be handled via prepared statements in Fannie code.
    Typically question marks are used instead of named placeholders.</li>
    <li>Queries should specify column names on SELECT and INSERT queries
    rather than assuming a particular column count and order.</li>
    <li>Results should be accessed by column name rather than numeric index</li>
    <li>Reasonable effort should be made to avoid using syntax only supported
    by one particular dialect of SQL. The SQLManager class provides helper
    methods for generating appropriate per-dialect syntax for many common
    situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
