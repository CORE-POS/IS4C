	<title>Install Guide: DEB</title>
</head>
<body>
This guide is for installing it-core from DEBs. These instructions
are based on Ubuntu, but should work on any Debian-ish distro.
<p />
This mostly command-line references. Be not afraid. It's just more
concise and accurate than verbally describing graphic interfaces.
<p />
<h3>Step one</h3>
Install your OS. If your chosen distribution doesn't have good 
documentation for this step, choose a new distribution.
<p />
<h3>Step two</h3>
Install some required packages.
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-ldap php5-cli php5-curl php-pear
</pre>
The first command, sudo, changes to the root user. You will be prompted for
root's password. The remainder installs a bunch of packages via apt, Debian's
package manager. The install process prompts you to set up a mysql password.
<h3>Step three</h3>
Download and install it-core. Your filenames may differ slightly, depending on
the version number.
<pre>
$ sudo dpkg -i it-core-0.1.0-1_all.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i it-core-doc-0.1.0-1_all.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i it-core-fannie-0.1.0-1_all.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i it-core-is4c-nf-0.1.0-1_all.deb
</pre>
These commands should be run as root. The base it-core package is always
required. The it-core-doc package is just documentation and thus always
optional. The it-core-fannie package contains the backend server; it-core-is4c-nf
contains the lane point of sale system. Neither is strictly required, but
omitting both wouldn't make much sense.
<h3>Step four</h3>
Start required services
<pre>
$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
$ sudo update-rc.d mysql defaults 
</pre>
The first command starts the mysql database. The second makes mysql start
automatically when the machine boots. Now do the same for apache.
<pre>
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
$ sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults
</pre>
<h3>Step five</h3>
Open a browser and go to http://localhost/it-core/. You should see at least a
license as well as documentation, fannie, and/or is4c-nf folders depending
on what you installed.

<h3>Further ideas (Production environment)</h3>
<ul>
<li>You probably want a static IP address. Go to System Settings =&gt; Internet and Network
=&gt; Network Connections (if your menu is different, try running nm-connection-editor
from the command line). Pick the appropriate connection - wired is recommended
- and edit.</li>
<li>You probably want SSH access. Ubuntu does not include it by default.
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
$ sudo update-rc.d ssh defaults
</pre> 
</li>
<li>VNC can be useful for remote debugging. Go to System Settings =&gt;
Internet and Network =&gt; Remote Desktop (if your menu is different, try running
vino-preferences from the command line). Turn on sharing. Security options
are up to you. A password is recommended. Automatically accepting connections
is not recommended. Tunneling VNC through SSH is more secure.
</li>
<li>Setting up a firewall is probably a good idea.
<pre>
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw default deny
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
$ sudo ufw allow from 127.0.0.1
</pre>
In order this turns on the firewall, denies all access by default, permits remote access via SSH, and permits full access locally.
</li>
</ul>
