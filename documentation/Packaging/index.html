The <i>dist</i> directory contains files &amp; scripts for
building distributable packages. 
<h1>RPM packaging</h1>
Tools for making rpms are in <i>dist/rpm</i>. To build, go
to that directory and run one of the two shell scripts.
<ul>
<li><b>setup-here.sh</b> requires one argument, a version number.
It builds an appropriate source tarball,modifies the spec file
and sets a user config file (~/.rpmmacros) to use this directory.</li>
<li><b>just-prep.sh</b> is for users that already have their own
rpm build environment. It also takes one argument, a version number,
and simply produces an appropriate source tarball and spec file for
use elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
The build doesn't have any requirements other than rpmbuild itself (note:
if you have trouble finding it, the OS package containing rpmbuild 
is often hyphenated as rpm-build.) The whole procedure looks like this
<pre style="background:#ccc;font-family:monospace;">
$ ./setup-here.sh
$ rpmbuild -ba SPECS/it-core.spec
</pre>
This creates four RPMs. Paths given below are typical and may vary on some
distributions:
<ul>
<li><b>it-core</b> contains the license (/usr/share/it-core/license) and
an apache config directive to point http://localhost/it-core at
/usr/share/it-core. This directory is chosen to comply with Red Hat
packaging guidelines for web applications, should IT CORE ever be submitted
for formal inclusion in a distribution.</li>
<li><b>it-core-doc</b> contains the documentation and installs to
/usr/share/it-core/documentation</li>
<li><b>it-core-fannie</b> contains the backend and installs to 
/usr/share/it-core/fannie. This package also assigns appropriate config
file permissions.</li>
<li><b>it-core-is4c-nf</b> contains the front-end and installs to 
/usr/share/it-core/is4c-nf. This package also assigns appropriate config
file permissions.</li>
</ul>
All RPMs require PHP 5+, Apache 2+, MySQL 5+, and php-mysql. The subpackages
each require the main it-core but are otherwise independent. 
<p />
Installation would look like this:
<pre style="background:#ccc;font-family:monospace;">
$ cd BUILD/noarch
$ sudo rpm -Uvh it-core-&lt;version&gt;.rpm
$ sudo /etc/init.d/httpd restart
$ sudo rpm -Uvh it-core-doc-&lt;version&gt;.rpm
$ sudo rpm -Uvh it-core-fannie-&lt;version&gt;.rpm
$ sudo rpm -Uvh it-core-is4c-nf-&lt;version&gt;.rpm
</pre>
Any of the last three lines could be omitted, although omitting all three would
be kind of silly.
