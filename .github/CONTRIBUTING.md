### Coding Standards
If you're writing code, please look over [Coding Standards](https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C/wiki/Coding-Standards) and [Git Branches](https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C/wiki/Git-Practices#branches).

### Issues
Issues that are really usage questions or discussions are allowed. Issues that are idle for more than a month may be closed but feel free to re-open them if more information becomes available. There's no hard and fast rule about which versions are supported but issues *may* be responded to with "please upgrade to the latest version first".
