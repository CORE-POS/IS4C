<H2>How CORE POS IS4C Pages are Constructed and Work</H2>
<p>Revised: 18Aug2012</p>
</div>

<p>This document walks through how a Top Level Page,
i.e. one whose name appears in the browser address bar
and whose initial source usually resides in /IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/gui-modules,
is assembled by PHP.
You may find this useful if you are new to object-oriented PHP, JavaScript, jQuery or JSON.
I wrote this as part of trying to become un-new to some of those.

<p>The initial subject subject will be pos2.php,
although we may find that too difficult and do a simpler one such as mgrlogin.php instead.
This commentary will not be exhaustive but I hope will illuminate most of the most important features.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div class="gray tt">
include_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../lib/AutoLoader.php');
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
This uses the PHP Magic Constant <tt>__FILE__</tt>
<br />See:<tt>http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php</tt>
<br />to refer to the path and name of the current file
and the <tt>dirname()</tt> function to reduce that to the path,
and then familiar code to point to
<tt>/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/lib/AutoLoader.php</tt>
<br />which points to 
<br /> - <tt>/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/lib/LocalStorage/conf.php</tt>
<br />which points to 
<br /> - <tt>/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/lib/LocalStorage/SessionStorage.php</tt>
<br />which defines and includes the class <tt>CORE_LOCAL</tt>,
which consists simply of two methods, which are used a great deal,
to <tt>set</tt> and <tt>get</tt> certain variables,
and a structure of other classes which I don't understand yet
but that are generally related to maintaining a session,
that is, information that persists between the instances of running <tt>pos2.php</tt>
that create the PoS transaction.
<br /><tt>AutoLoader.php</tt> itself contains classes for finding the other files
that the Top Level Page might refer to and makes a persistent list or map of them
using <tt>$CORE_LOCAL->set</tt> and <tt>->get</tt>.
It is essential that naming conventions be observed,
e.g. that a class <tt>FooBar</tt> be defined in a file called <tt>FooBar.php</tt>
</li>

<li>
<div class="gray tt">
new pos2();
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
Next, find the above line at the end of the listing.
It says to run the function <tt>pos2</tt>.
Go back to the top of the listing to find where <tt>pos2</tt> is defined.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<div class="gray tt">
class pos2 extends BasicPage {
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
In the above, <tt>extends</tt> means that the class being defined, <tt>pos2</tt>,
is a child of <tt>BasicPage</tt> that inherits from it and may add to and redefine parts of it.
To understand <tt>pos2</tt> we must first understand <tt>BasicPage</tt>
which is defined in
<br /><tt>/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/gui-class-lib/BasicPage.php</tt>
<br />Go there now.
</p>
<p>(If you read through <tt>pos2</tt> you will notice it contains only functions
and no calls to them, i.e. nothing exectuable.
To learn how <tt>pos2()</tt> actually does anything study <tt>BasicPage</tt>.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<div class="gray tt">
function BasicPage(){
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
Find the above line towards the top of the listing.
A function, or method, to use the correct oo term,
with the same name as the class it is in is called a <em>Constructor</em>,
and, unlike other methods, is run each time an instance of the class,
or a child of it, such as <tt>pos2()</tt> is created with <tt>new</tt>.
</p>
<p>The constructor, <tt>BasicPage()</tt> runs it's <tt>preprocess()</tt> method
and possibly its <tt>print_page()</tt> method.
There is a useful comment about <tt>preprocess()</tt> in the code at this point:
<blockquote>It is typically
    used to check $_GET or $_POST variables. If the
    function returns True, the rest of the page will be
    printed. If the function returns False, there is no
    output. Usually this function returns False after
    setting a redirect header to change to another page.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Now go back to <tt>pos2.php</tt> to see whether either of those methods have been
redefined for use there.
It turns out that <tt>preprocess()</tt> has and <tt>print_page()</tt> has not,
although other methods of <tt>BasicPage</tt> which are called by <tt>print_page()</tt>,
including <tt>body_content()</tt>, have.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre class="gray">
&lt;form name="form" id="formlocal" method="post" autocomplete="off"
action="pos2.php" onsubmit="return submitWrapper();" &gt;
&lt;input name="reginput" value="" onblur="$('#reginput').focus();"
type="text" id="reginput"  /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p class="first">
Before examining <tt>preprocess</tt> look at the <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> that captures
the <tt>POST</tt> variables that <tt>preprocess()</tt> will handle.
It is quite simple, with only one <tt>input</tt>, with <tt>name="reginput"</tt>,
the input being sent back to itself <tt>action="pos2.php"</tt>
and <tt>onsubmit="return submitWrapper();"</tt>.
The latter is the subject of most of the rest of this page.
</p>

<li>
<div class="gray tt">
if (Authenticate::check_password($_REQUEST['reginput'])){
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
NOT TRUE. login2.php calls itself to check password and then runs pos2.
<br />$this->change_page($this->page_url."gui-modules/pos2.php");
<br />The first time <tt>pos2.php</tt> is called is from <tt>login2.php</tt>
which submits a form variable named <tt>reginput</tt>, the same as <tt>pos2</tt>'s own variable,
containing the password of a cashier.
Let's look at what <tt>preprocess</tt> does with this value, a two-to-four-digit number.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="gray tt">
x pos2();
</div><!-- /.gray -->
<p class="first">
<br />The first time <tt>pos2.php</tt> is called is from <tt>login2.php</tt>,
with no <tt>GET</tt> or <tt>POST</tt> variables.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
