Table: efsnetResponse

Columns:

	cashierNo int
	laneNo int
	transNo int
	transID int
	datetime datetime
	refNum varchar
	seconds float
	commErr int
	httpCode int
	validResponse smallint
	xResponseCode varchar
	xResultCode varchar
	xResultMessage varchar
	xTransactionID varchar
	xApprovalNumber varchar
    efsnetRequestID int

Depends on:
	efsnetRequest (table)

Use:
This table logs information that is
returned from a credit-card payment gateway
after sending a [non-void] request.
All current paycard modules use this table
structure. Future ones don't necessarily have
to, but doing so may enable more code re-use.

Some column usage may vary depending on a
given gateway's requirements and/or formatting,
but in general:

cashierNo, laneNo, transNo, and transID are
equivalent to emp_no, register_no, trans_no, and
trans_id in dtransactions (respectively).

seconds, commErr, and httpCode are curl-related
entries noting how long the network request took
and errors that occurred, if any.

the x* columns vary a lot. What to store here 
depends what the gateway returns.
