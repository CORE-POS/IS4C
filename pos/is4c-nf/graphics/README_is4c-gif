is4c.gif is used as a background image on the main PoS page.
peoples_coop_logo.gif is an example of a suitable image,
i.e. it is 670 x 510 pixels on a white background with
the image roughly in the middle.
The distributed is4c.gif is symbolic link to, by default,
 a placeholder that reads: Your Logo Here
 your_logo_here.gif
 If you have a better image, change the link to that:
 $ rm is4c.gif
 $ ln -s my_better_image.gif is4c.gif
 If you don't want any image:
 $ rm is4c.gif
 $ ln -s empty.gif is4c.gif

The use of this background image is spcified in:
/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/css/pos.css
.mainBGimage {
	background-image: url('../graphics/is4c.gif');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
