is4c.gif is used as a background image on the main PoS page.
peoples_coop_logo.gif is an example of a suitable image.
The distributed is4c.gif is symbolic link to, by default,
 a tiny, empty image; a placeholder.
 If you have a better image, change the link to that:
 $ rm is4c.gif
 $ ln -s my_better_image.gif is4c.gif
