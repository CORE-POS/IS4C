To use a custom background, create (or link to) a file

of a suitable image, i.e. it is 670 x 510 pixels on a white 
background with the image roughly in the middle.
 
If you don't want any image:
$ rm is4c.gif
$ ln -s empty.gif is4c.gif

The use of this background image is spcified in:
/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/css/pos.css
.mainBGimage {
	background-image: url('../graphics/is4c.gif');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
