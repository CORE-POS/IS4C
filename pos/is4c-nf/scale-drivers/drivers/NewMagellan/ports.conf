# ports.conf - port configuration file
#
# How to use:
# Uncomment, i.e. remove the leading "#" from the lines for
#  the ports/services you are actually using.
# Be sure the device is connected to the port named.
# The "handler class" is in a file of that name with a .cs extension,
#  e.g. SPH_Magellan.cs
# If pos.exe does not already exist or the handler has changed,
#  compile pos.exe:
#  $ make clean
#  $ make
#
# Format:
# <name of port> <name of handler class>
