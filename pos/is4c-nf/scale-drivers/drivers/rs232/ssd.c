   This is the preliminary daemon that effectively acts as part of the
   driver for the single cable Magellan scanner scale on the Linux platform.
   The settings for the serial port communication parameters are
   based on the factory defaults for Magellan. The polling behaviour,
   likewise is based on the technical specs for the Magellan.
   Details are listed in the document scrs232.doc in the installation directory.

   In brief, what the daemon does is to listen in on the serial port
   for in-coming data. It puts the last scanned input in
   the file "/pos/is4c/rs232/scanner".
   Similiarly it puts the last weight input in the
   file "/pos/is4c/rs232/scale".
   The pages chkscale.php and chkscanner check these
   files and assign their contents to the appropriate global variables.

   To set up the daemon, compile ssd.c and arrange for it
   to run at boot time.

 *  5Aug12 EL Resolve conflict from merge from CORE.  Hope I didn't wreck it.
 * 18Apr12 EL This file must be writable by Apache/PHP because
 *             the lane Install page, Extra Config section:
 * http://localhost/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/install/extra_config.php
 *             removes "/var/www/IS4C/pos/is4c-nf/" from the scale and scanner
 *             paths to reduce them to the equivalent of ./, i.e.
 *              scale-drivers/drivers/rs232/
 *             But the driver cannot be started/won't-run configured this way,
 *              so restore from commented versions below and re-compile.
 *             I wonder if this is why the lane app hasn't been able to do
 *              anything with scans and weights yet, i.e. doesn't seem to be
 *              aware of them.
 * 14Apr12 EL Add comments.
 *            scale and scanner must exist, 666; this does not create them.
 *  7Apr12 EL Remove ^M's
 *            Change locations of scale and scanner files.
