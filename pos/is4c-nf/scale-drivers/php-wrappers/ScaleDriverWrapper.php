/** @class ScaleDriverWrapper
    PHP Module for talking to hardware

    This class deals with reading and writing
    to hardware devices that PHP can't talk to
    directly. Normally this means "scanner scale".
    All drivers should provide a ScaleDriverWrapper
    subclass.

    Modules that extend this class must at least define
    ReadFromScale and WriteToScale.

      and in many cases the driver also needs to be

      fine.
