<h3>Other Keyboard Commands</h3>
This document lists full commands, but IS4C is normally used with a programmable keyboard
so cashiers don't have to memorize commands. Unless otherwise noted,
commands are <b>not</b> case sensitive.

<h3>Sign out the current cashier</h3>
Type SO then press enter. This returns to the log in screen and opens
the till drawer if present. You can not sign out in the middle of a transaction.

<h3>Lock the register</h3>
Type LOCK then press enter. You must re-enter the cashier password to unlock
the register before proceeding with any other actions.

<h3>Cancel the current transaction</h3> 
Type CN then press enter. Canceling a
transaction requires an actual cashier's password. You cannot use the 9999
training password here.

<h3>Accept foodstamps</h3>
Before foodstamps can be tendered, you must generate a foodstamp total. Type
FNTL then press enter. This total is all items on the current transaction that
are marked as foodstampable. Sales tax is not collected on items purchased
using foodstamps. Proper procedure may well vary from state to state, so
check your local regulations.

<h3>Disable sales tax for this transaction</h3>
Type TETL then press enter. You will be prompted for an optional tax exemption
ID. This is added to the transaction as a comment for the sake of
record keeping.

<h3>Suspend/Resume</h3>
If you want to finish the current transaction later, the transaction can be suspended.
If a server database is available, the suspended transaction is sent there
and can be resumed from any register. If no server is available, the transaction
is suspended locally and must be resumed from the same register.

To suspend the current transaction, type MG then press enter. Scroll down to
"Suspend Transaction" using the arrow keys, then press enter again.
<p />
To resume the a transaction, type MG then press enter. Scroll down to
"Resume Transaction" using the arrow keys, then press enter again. Scroll
through the list of available suspended transactions, and press enter on
more time to select the one you'd like to resume. Note
that you may not resume a transaction if another transaction is currently
in progress.
