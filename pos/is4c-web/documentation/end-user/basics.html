Alright, let's sell some products! This document lists full 
commands, but IS4C is normally used with a programmable keyboard
so cashiers don't have to memorize commands. Unless otherwise noted,
commands are <b>not</b> case sensitive.
<h3>The [clear] command</h3>
One very important command to know is clear: type CL then press enter.
This key sequence will dismiss most errors and warnings and cancel
most procedures taking you back to the "main" screen.
<h3>Logging in</h3>
The first screen is a login screen. A cashier must enter a numeric 
password to begin. Type the password and press enter.
If you're just testing, 9999 is the built in
training password, and 52 and 7000 are the passwords provided
in the sample employee data.
<p />
By default, if a logged in register is idle for awhile, it will
automatically lock. To unlock a register, type the same password you
used to log in and press enter.
<h3>Ringing Up Items</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>By UPC/PLU</i> type in the item's UPC or PLU and hit enter.
Leading zeroes may be omitted. Whether or not to include check
digits is a store-specific decision (I think most don't). If you
include check digits in your product table, they should be included 
here and vice versa</li>
<li><i>Open Rings</i> type the amount, DP, the department's number,
zero, and hit enter. Amounts in IS4C typically do not include a
decimal point and are measured in <b>cents</b>. So to ring up one
dollar to department number one, you would type "100DP10" then
press enter.</li>
<li><i>Made a mistake?</i> there are two ways to void an item
that was already entered. First, scroll up or down using the arrow
keys until the item is highlighted. Then type VD and press enter.
Alternately, you can type VD then the item's UPC or PLU and
press enter.</li>
<li><i>Buying more than one?</i> if a customer is buying lots
of the same product, you can enter the quantity they're buying,
an asterisk, and the UPC or PLU then press enter. With items
that are sold by weight, you can also enter fractional quantities.
This is one situation where a decimal point is used.
It can be useful for testing without a scale present.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entering the member number</h3>
IS4C is built for co-ops, and with that in mind every transaction
requires a member number. Non-member transactions require a number, too,
but you can use the same number for all non-member transactions. Which
number is up to you. The setting is located in 
<a href="configuration.html">Additional Configuration</a>.
<ul>
<li><i>If the member number is known</i>, type the member number, then
ID, and press enter. This takes you to a list of names on the membership.
Scroll up or down with the arrow keys, then press enter to select one.
The name selection step is omitted for the generic non-member number,
but otherwise always included - even for memberships with just one name
on the account. Confirming the member's name helps catch occasional typos
when entering the member number.</li>
<li><i>If the member number is not known</i>, type ID and press enter.
The member search accepts both member numbers and last names. Partial
last names are permitted but are matched from the beginning - i.e.,
searching for "john" will find a member whose last name is Johnson,
but searching for "ohnson" will not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accepting tender</h3>
The most common error with tenders will state "transaction must be totaled"
or some variation of that. Entering the member number (see above) totals
the transaction. However, if you continue ringing up items after entering
the member number, the transaction must be re-totaled. To re-total a transaction,
type TL then press enter.
<p />
The default to enter tender is to type the amount (in cents) and the two
character tender code, then press enter. For example, to tender $2.50 in cash,
you would type 250CA and press enter. You can add as many as you like, but 
common tenders in the default installation include:
<ul>
<li>CA - Cash</li>
<li>CK - Check</li>
<li>CC - Credit Card</li>
<li>DC - Debit Card</li>
<li>CP - Coupon</li>
<li>GD - Gift Card</li>
</ul>
If peripherals are present, at this point the receipt prints and
the till drawer opens.
