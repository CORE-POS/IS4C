		<title>Howto Write A Paycard Module</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	This is a guide to writing a paycard class that can be used with
	IS4C. This is not a guide to PCI compliance. Asking whether is a
	given module is PCI compliant is probably the wrong approach.
	Modules shouldn't retain any credit card numbers, but I highly
	encourage you to trace through and verify that to your own satisfaction.
	Even that, however, is a small facet of PCI compliance.
	<p />
	OK, no more soapbox. Most payment gateways are actually pretty simple.
	You take some data - card info, amount, transaction type, etc - format
	it to the gateway's liking - as HTTP, XML, SOAP, etc - and send it
	to an HTTPS URL. The gateway sends a response, again formatted somehow,
	telling you what happened. Generally this response is approved,
	declined, or an error message.
	<p />
	In a lot of cases, all that really varies from one gateway to another
	is the formatting of what you send and the formatting of how it
	replies. That leaves a lot of potential for code re-use and
	interchangeable payment modules.
	<h3>Primer: Credit Cards</h3>
	Some collective knowledge on cards isn't a bad idea, although doubtless I don't know everything.
	<p />
	Your basic credit card transaction consists of two parts: an <i>auth</i> transaction requests
	funds from the customer's bank, and a <i>settle</i> transaction that actually transfers
	funds to your account. A <i>settle</i> must correspond to an existing <i>auth</i>. Most
	gateways provide another type of transaction that combines the two - an auth that will
	automatically settle - but terminology varies from one to another.
	<p />
	The other common credit card operations are <i>void</i> and <i>credit</i>. A <i>void</i>
	transaction cancels an existing <i>auth</i> - sort of. If you <i>void</i> an <i>auth</i>,
	it will never <i>settle</i>, but it may hang on the cardholder's account as a pending
	charge. How long this pending charge sticks around is up to the issuing bank; as the
	merchant, it's out of your control. A <i>credit</i> transaction is a refund.
	<p />
	Most gateways will accept either a card number, commonly called PAN, and expiration
	date <b>or</b> track data. Track data is what's on the magnetic stripe. Sending track
	data will generally result in significantly lower processing charges. Most cards have
	two tracks, actually called <i>Track 1</i> and <i>Track 2</i>. You may or may not
	get both depending on the card and how readable the stripe is. You can generally
	send either or both. The exact format required may vary from processor to processor.
	Note the parsing functions in lib/paycardLib.php remove start and end sentinel
	characters; if your gateway wants them, the start and end for track 1 are
	(normally) "%" and "?". The start and end for track 2 are ";" and "?".
	<h3>Primer: Gift Cards</h3>
	These probably vary more from provider to provider. When a customer uses their gift card
	as tender, IS4C calls this an <i>auth</i> transaction. Gift cards also usually include
	transaction types to check current balance, activate a new card, and add value
	to an activated card. Refunds to a gift card map nicely to <i>add value</i>. If there
	isn't a specific <i>void</i> transaction, you can fake one with auths and add values
	to reverse earlier transactions.
	<h3>BasicCCModule Class</h3>
	This class has a few methods that are required by every implementation
	and a few utility functions that may be helpful. First, required methods:
	<ul>
	<li><b>handlesType(string_type)</b> - paycard types are defined in lib/paycardLib.php.
	A paycard module should return True for the types of transaction (credit, gift,
	etc) that it handles and False for all other. When multiple modules are enabled,
	this method dictates which is used for a given entry.</li>
	<li><b>entered(bool_validate,array_json)</b> - this method is called during parsing, so
	it should return a json array like a parser module. Normally one is passed in
	that you can work with. Mostly what happens here is validating the given card
	can be processed and setting up session variables. If your module uses the
	existing efsnet* or valutec* tables, you can probably copy
	this out of an existing credit or gift module (depending what you're writing)
	without much modification.</li>
	<li><b>paycard-void(int_transID)</b> - this method is similar to entered() but focused
	on voids. Again the return is a json array.
	There are a few extra checks to ensure a void-able transaction occurred,
	it hasn't been voided already, etc. Again, you can likely lift this out of an
	existing gift or credit module.</li>
	<li><b>doSend(string_type)</b> - this method should send formatted data to
	the gateway and process the results. WFC's modules all follow a similar structure
	for doing this, but following the pattern isn't required. The return value should be
	PAYCARD_ERR_OK, a defined constant, if the transaction succeeded. If the transaction
	didn't succeed, the return value can be <i>anything</i> else. Failed doSend()s are
	directed to gui-modules/boxMsg2.php. Set any error message to display in
	$IS4C_LOCAL->boxMsg.</li>
	<li><b>cleanup(array_json)</b> - this method is called when doSend succeeds. The return
	type is a json array. Typical things to do here include printing receipts and
	tendering.</li>
	</ul>
	I normally put a switch statement in doSend and have a separate send function for each sub-type of
	transaction (auth, void, etc). Each send function builds an appropriate data "block"
	and sends it using curlSend(). In turn, curlSend() gives the result to handlesResponse().
	From there I use another switch on type with handleResponse functions for each type.
	There's no particular reason doSend needs to be implemented this way, but if you're trying to
	trace along that's the general plan.
	<h3>What's Going to Go Wrong?</h3>
	Implementation isn't so bad, but there are potential problems (if anyone knows solutions, clue
	me in and I'll happily trim this list).
	<ul>
	<li>The big, glaring one: if your internet goes down, so does card processing. I have separate,
	dedicated terminals around anyway for PIN transactions and those can do dial up transactions.
	That may be the simplest, albeit not cheapest, solution.</li>
	<li>Curl Errors: sometimes the send/receive process fails. If it's just a random hiccup,
	most gateways provide a method for querying transaction status. I don't do this; normally
	when I have connection problems, I have several in a row, so I batch-void everything
	that had problems on a regular basis.</li>
	</ul>
