Unit tests are built using PHPUnit. Use bootstrap.php with
PHPUnit's --bootstrap option. This file sets up $CORE_LOCAL,
loads the configuration from ini.php, and sets up class
autoloading. 

A functional database (and correct configuration in ini.php)
is required. The unit tests can be run in any order. Adding
more scripted testing that runs the install to create+initialize
databases and then runs all the tests would be a good next step.
