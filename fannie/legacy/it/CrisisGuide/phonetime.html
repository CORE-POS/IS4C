<title>Phone Time
</head>
<body>
Our phone system is unaware of modern changes to
daylight saving time, so it's off a few times a year
minimum. To change the phone time:
<ol>
<li>Go to a master phone. The master phones are CSC
and the IT office. The latter is probably easier.</li>
<li>Leaving the receiver down, press Feature, 9, #</li>
<li>The time will start flashing on the display. Use the
number keys to enter the correct time.</li>
<li>Press Feature again to complete the change</li>
</ol>
