Occasionally, the time clock will stop sending punches
to ADP. There's no real rhyme or reason to it; ADP's software
simply stops working now and then. To fix this:
<ol>
<li>Open <a href="http://192.168.1.99:5800">http://192.168.1.99:5800</a> in
a browser. You may have to accept a certificate when prompted. After the 
page loads you will be prompted for a password. The password is <b>IS4C</b>.
	<ul><li>If this step doesn't work, the payroll machine is probably 
		turned off. Turning it back on should fix the problem.
		It is a black PC located in the IT office with a fancy duct
		tape label reading "Payroll"</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the start menu and choose "Turn off computer" then "Restart"</li>
</ol>
If you need to get punches over to ADP <i>immediately</i>, access the payroll
machine as described in step #1 and double click the desktop icon labeled
<i>Send Punches to ezLaborManager</i>. After punches are sent, the machine
should still be restarted.
