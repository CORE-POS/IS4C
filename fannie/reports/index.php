<ul>
<li>Movement Reports are a collection of reports relating to per-UPC sales stats
	<ul>
	<li><a href="DepartmentMovement/">Department Movement</a> lists sales
		for a department or group of departments over a given date range.</li>
	<li><a href="ManufacturerMovement/">Manufacturer Movement</a> lists sales
		for products from a specific manufacturer over a given date range.
		Manufacturer is given either by name or as a UPC prefix.</li>
	<li><a href="ProductMovement/">Product Movement</a> lists sales for a 
		specific UPC over a given date range.</li>
	<li><a href="CorrelatedMovement/">Correlated Movement</a> shows what
		items purchasers from a certain department or group of departments
		also buy. Optionally, results can be filtered by department too.
		This may be clearer with an example: among transactions that
		include a sandwich, what do sales from the beverages department
		look like?</li>
	<li><a href="NonMovement/">Non-Movement</a> shows items in a department
		or group of departments that have no sales over a given date range.
		This is mostly for finding discontinued or mis-entered products.</li>
	<li><a href="Trends/">Trends</a> shows daily sales totals for items
		over a given date range. Items can be included by UPC, department,
		or manufacturer.</li>
	<li><a href="MonthOverMonth/">Monthly Movement</a> shows monthly sales totals
		for items or departments.</li>
	<li><a href="MovementPrice/">Movement by Price</a> lists item sales with
		a separate line for each price point. If an item was sold at more
		than one price in the given date range, sales from each	price
		are listed separately.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Sales Reports are a higher level collection generally relating to store-wide sales
	<ul>
	<li><a href="GeneralSales/">General Sales Report</a> shows total sales per
		department for a given date range in dollars as well as a percentage
		of store-wide sales.</li>
	<li><a href="GeneralCosts/">General Costs Report</a> shows total costs per
		department for a given date range in dollars as well as a percentage
		of store-wide costs. It uses actual item cost if known and estimates
		cost from price and department margin if not; relies on department margins being accurate.</li>
	<li><a href="SalesToday/">Today's Sales</a> shows current day totals by hour.</li>
	<li><a href="HourlySales/">Store Hourly Sales</a> lists store-wide sales per hour
		over a given date range.</li>
	<li><a href="HourlySales/hourlySalesDept.php">Department Hourly Sales</a> lists
		sales per hour over a given date range for a subset of departments.</li>
	</ul>
<li><a href="../item/productList.php">Product List</a> is a cross between a report and 
	a tool. It lists current item prices and status flags for a department or set
	of departments but also allows editing.</li>
<li><a href="PriceHistory/">Price History</a> shows what prices an item as been
	assigned over a given time period.</li>
<li><a href="DepartmentSettings/">Department Settings</a> provides a quick overview
	of current department settings for margin, tax, and foodstamp status.</li>
<li><a href="OpenRings/">Open Rings</a> shows UPC-less sales for a department or
	group of departments over a given date range.</li>
<li><a href="BatchReport/">Batch Report</a> lists sales for items in a 
	sales batch (or group of sales batches).</li>
<li><a href="CustomerCount/">Customer Count</a> lists the number of customers
	per day, separated by membership type.</li>
</ul>
