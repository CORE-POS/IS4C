/* HELP

   nightly.clipboard.php

   This script truncates the table batchCutPaste. This table
   acts as a clipboard so users can cut/paste items from
   on sales batch to another. The table must be truncated
   periodically or old data will linger indefinitely.	

   It also clears stale, deleted shelftags from the
   shelftags table. Entries hang around with a negative
   id for recovery in the case of mistakes.
