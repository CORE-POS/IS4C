/* HELP

   nightly.tablecache.php

   Something of a catch-all, this script is used generically
   to load data into lookup tables. Generally this means copying
   data from relatively slow views into tables so subesquent
   queries against that data will be faster.

   This currently affects cashier performance reporting and
   batch movement reporting.
