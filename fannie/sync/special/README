By default, Fannie is set to use SQLManager's transfer method
to move tables between servers. This does work, regardless
of how SQL Server & MySQL are mixed on the network, but is not
particularly fast for large tables.

Scripts in this directory allow alternate, customized data 
transfer. The normal table sync procedure will check for matching
custom scripts and use those instead if applicable. Matching is
based on table name - e.g., if syncing the table "products",
Fannie checks for a file here named "products.php".

Matching files are called using include().

I recommend using non-matching names (e.g., "products.wfc.php")
so that if there is any SVN collaboration, people don't overwrite
each other's customizations. Symlinks can point the correct
name at whichever file(s) you actually want to use.
