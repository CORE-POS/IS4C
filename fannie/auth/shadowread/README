This is a simple program to read password hashes from
a shadowed password file. I originally wanted to use PAM,
but the "offical" PHP PAM suggestion was "make the shadow
password file group readable", which frankly doesn't seem
any more secure than this. I'm using the setuid bit instead
to grant this program restricted access to the shadow file.

USAGE:
shadowread requires one argument: a username

RETURNS: 
	0 if a hash is found for the user;
	1 in all other cases

NOTES:
* shadowread will not honor requests for user 'root'
* If the password hash field has a length less than 5,
  shadowread assumes the user has no password

INSTALL:
$ make
# make install
