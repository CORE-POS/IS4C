The subdirectories, whose names match $FANNIE_COOP_ID for particular coops,
contain code that can be PHP include()'d by $FANNIE/src/navbar.html
to add options to the menu that will only appear for a the coop whose
$FANNIE_COOP_ID matches the subdirectory name.

The files in the subdirectories are named:

main-list.php           For a section in the top-level navbar.html menu.
main-index.php          A separate page the heading of that menu might link to.

report-sales-list.php   A sub-list within the Reports > Sales group.

navbar.php              A menu to completely replace $FANNIE/src/navbar.html
.                       Called from header.html
