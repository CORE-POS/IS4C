 * 4Jul13   Require admin priv.
 * Changes to the item edit suite:
 * + The changes were initially to support part of our ordering apparatus which
 *    involves:
 *    . import of data from a spreadsheet, which consolidates data from orders
 *      where some same-PLU'd items come from different suppliers.
 *    . editing of product-related tables between loads
 *    . export of data to the ordering system
 * + It also supports the longer description field in productUser and has the
 *    option to compose it for the PoS Product Verification function.
 * + I learned, stumbled into, functionality that suggests how other coops work
 *    with item data and realize now that some of what I added or changed may
 *    not be viewed by others as progress.
 *    I tried to make some features more obvious in hopes they might be used
 *     more at my coop.
 * + I didn't touch the scale items code, which we don't use.
 * + I wasn't able to test the multi-store code because we have only one.
 * -> I didn't change the likecodes handling but haven't tested it.
 * + Others may not want this editor to touch vendorItems, preferring it to
 *    come from vendors, but we do not get machine-readable data from vendors.
 * + Edit tables productUser, vendorItems and a table of per-coop product data.
 * + In edit form, group some inputs into blocks that can be displayed
 *    optionally, controlled by a module-name-like value.
 * + The fieldsets all float and have been made a regular size so they will
 *    will rearrange themselves sort of neatly, a la the membership editor does.
 * $Fannie_Item_Modules = array("Operations","ExtraInfo",
 * + Extend edit to products.size, .unitofmeasure, vendorItems.sku
 * + "Module" blocks for Sale and Multiples (3-for-$1) values.
 * -> JS Calendars for date fields.
 * + Use "module" setting to control whether exisiting multiples code that is
 *    an alternatice to the regular Price is enabled.
 * + The module-control array is not yet part of config.php or an install page,
 *    in part pending seeing how Andy did his modularization of the editor.
 * + Compose, optionally, products.descriptin and productUser.description with
 *    "package" description "200 g" appended.
 * + JS counter for length of products.description, with or without appended
 *    pacakge info.
 * + Regularize some variable names betwee updateItems, insertItem and deleteItem
 * + Use showAsMoney() and saveAsMoney() to prepare money values for display and writing to table.
 *    saveAsMoney() inserts decimals if the value in the form lacks them.
 * + Initial item# prompt extended to make options more obvious and made into a
 *    function that is used throughout.
 * + Extend lane updates to multiple lane-side tables.
