        return '<p>Purchase Orders are for incoming inventory - i.e., 
            items the store purchases from a vendor and then sells to
            customers. Purchase Orders depend on vendor data and especially
            vendor item catalogs. Only items in a vendor catalog can be
            added to a purchase order.</p>
            <p>Purchase Orders may include two separate sets of quantity
            and cost fields. One set is for the number of items ordered
            and expected cost. The other set is for the number of items
            acutally received and received cost.</p>
            <p>View and Search are straightforward. Import creates a purchase
            order from a spreadsheet. Creating orders by vendor results
            in a single order. Only UPCs and SKUs from the chosen vendor
            can be added. Creating orders by item will match UPCs and SKUs
            from all known vendors. This option creates separate orders
            for each vendor as needed.</p>
