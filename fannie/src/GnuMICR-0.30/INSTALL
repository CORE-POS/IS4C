If you're using this font under Microsoft Windows, I can't help you.

If you're using it under a Linux-y operating system, there are documents
available which do a better job than I ever would at explaining how to
install them.

In general, take a look at the Font-HOWTO, available from
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO.html particularly

"Making Fonts Available To X"
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO-4.html

and

"Making Fonts Available to GhostScript"
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Font-HOWTO-5.html

I have included a test PostScript(tm) file called "test.ps" that you can
fire up in GhostScript to see if you have that set up correctly.

I have also included a file, "symbols.png" to show you which characters
you need to type to get the various MICR symbols.

Note that to function in the MICR readers, this font must be sized
exactly right.  GnuMICR is designed to be used at 12 point size.

Good luck!
