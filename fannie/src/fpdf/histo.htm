<BLOCKQUOTE>
- When the font subdirectory is in the same directory as fpdf.php, it is no longer necessary to define the FPDF_FONTPATH constant.<BR>

- Fixed a problem related to Type1 font embedding which caused trouble to some PDF processors.<BR>
- The file name sent to the browser could not contain a space character.<BR>
- The Cell() method could not print the number 0 (you had to pass the string '0').<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- Type1 font support.<BR>

- The class now works internally in points with the origin at the bottom in order to avoid two bugs occurring with Acrobat 5 :<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;* The line thickness was too large when printed under Windows 98 SE and ME.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;* TrueType fonts didn't appear immediately inside the plug-in (a substitution font was used), one had to cause a window refresh to make them show up.<BR>

- The clickable area in a cell was always on the left independently from the text alignment.<BR>
- JPEG images in CMYK mode appeared in inverted colors.<BR>
