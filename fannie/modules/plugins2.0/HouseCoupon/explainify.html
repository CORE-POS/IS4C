<h1>Explanation of House Coupon terms and options</h1>
First, the simple ones:
<ul>
<li><b>Expires</b> is when the coupon runs through, inclusive. E.g., if the expiration date is
January 31, 2010, the coupon will ring as "expired" starting February 1, 2010
<li><b>Limit</b> is the number of times the coupon can be used <i>per transaction</i>
<li><b>Member-only</b> coupons can only be used by members
<li><b>Department</b> dicates how the discount gets coded by the POS
</ul>
<h3>Required purchases</h3>
The bulk of features are here. The settings for minimum purchase dictate which kinds
of discounts can be applied. Many of these have similar options for <i>at least</i>
and <i>more than</i>. The usage is the same for all of them and affects how the minimum 
is applied. E.g., if a soda coupon requires a quantity of at least 2, then purchasing
2 sodas is enough to use the coupon. On the other hand, if the requirement was a
quantity of more than 2, then 3 (or more) soda purchases would be needed.
<ul>
<li><b>Quantity</b> (Q, Q+) requires a minimum purchase of specific items. Quantity is
measured by each or by the pound depending on the setting for the item. A quantity
minimum must have items associated with it. This is the one of the more flexible
minimum types; it works with every discount type except <i>scaling discount (department)</i>
<li><b>Department</b> (D, D+) requires a minimum total purchase across the selected departments.
Purchase is measured in dollars rather than quantity. Applicable discount types are
<i>scaling discount (department)</i>, <i>flat discount</i>, and <i>percent discount</i>.
<li><b>Mixed</b> (M) is the most complicated minimum type (yet). The customer must purchase
at least the specified quantity of <i>qualifying</i> items and some quantity of <i>discount</i>
items. Mixed discount is the only case where an item's QUALIFIER/DISCOUNT/BOTH setting
should be used. Like quantity discount, mixed discount can be used with any discount
type except <i>scaling discount (department)</i>
<li><b>Total</b> ($, $+) discount simply refers to the total of the entire transaction in
dollars. No specific items or departments are associated with this minimum. The only
applicable discount types are <i>flat discount</i> and <i>percent discount</i>
<li><b>No minimum</b> (blank) is exactly what it sounds like.
</ul>
<h3>Discount types</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Quantity</b> discount gives a certain number of items free. Fractions are OK, so
this ends up being like a percent discount. A value of 1.0 gives an item for free, a value of
0.5 gives an item for 50% off, etc. The discount is always applied to the cheapest valid item.
<li><b>Set Price</b> discount locks in the coupon price. Regardless of the regular price, the 
price with coupon will be exactly what's specified here.
<li><b>Flat Discount (Item)</b> discounts the chepeast applicable item by the specified amount.
This scales with quantity to deal with by-weight items.
<li><b>Flat Discount (Department)</b> is the same as above except for an item in the specified
department(s) instead of a specific UPC
<li><b>Flat Discount</b> removes exactly the given amount, once, from the transaction
<li><b>Percent Discount</b> provides a percentage off all discountable items (e.g., member 
appreciation month)
    <ul>
    <li><i>End of transaction</i> must be applied at the end of the transaction.</li>
    <li><i>Anytime</i> can be entered at anytime but may interact with member's percent
        discount in unexpected ways depending what order everything occurs.</li>
    <li><i>Department</i> applies only to items in the chosen department(s)</li>
    <li><i>Capped</i> discount is limited to the first $X of the transaction.
        Example: 5% off the first $50 would be 50.05. 
    </ul>
</ul>
