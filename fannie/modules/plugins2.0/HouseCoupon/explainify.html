    <h1 style="font-size:1.4em; text-align:center;">Explanation of<br />House Coupon<br />Terms and Options</h1>
<!-- p>Even if the coupon is not a traditional printed one
it is helpful to keep the characteristics of printed ones
in mind.
</p -->
<!-- h3>EL Questions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Anytime.  Means?: coupon can be entered at any point in the transaction. versus Must be entered at the end, after Subtotal
    <li>x
</ul -->

<h3>First, the simple ones:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Begins</b> is when the coupon becomes effective.
    The coupon will not be applied, or be accepted, before this date.
    This makes it possible to set coupons, especially auto coupons,
    up in advance, as is done for sale batches.
    <li><b>Expires</b> is when the coupon runs through, inclusive.
    E.g., if the expiration date is January 31, 2010, the coupon will ring as "expired" starting February 1, 2010
    <li><b>Limit</b> is the number of times the coupon can be used <i>per transaction</i>
    <li><b>Member-only</b> coupons can only be used by members
    <li><b>Department</b> dicates how the discount gets coded by the POS.
    If the coupon involves more than one department,
    select the first one here, then, after selecting the appropriate
    <span class="b">Discount Type</span>, click <span class="b">Save</span>,
    to expose the form for selecting more departments.
<!--
The amount of the discount is credited to this department,
in other words sales of the department are reduced by the amount of the discount.
There can be a dedicated Discounts department for coupons that don't apply to
a single department.
-->
    <li><b>Auto</b> if Yes, will be applied automatically,
without the customer/member needing to present or mention it,
[?when the transaction is totalled].
</ul>

<h3>Required purchases</h3>
The bulk of features are here.
The settings for minimum purchase quantity dictate which kinds of discounts can be applied.
Many of these have similar options for <i>at least</i> and <i>more than</i>.
The usage is the same for all of them and affects how the minimum is applied.
E.g., if a soda coupon requires a quantity of at least 2, then purchasing
2 sodas is enough to use the coupon. On the other hand, if the requirement was a
quantity of more than 2, then 3 (or more) soda purchases would be needed.
<ul>
    <li><b>Quantity</b> (Q, Q+) requires a minimum purchase of specific items.
    Quantity is measured by weight or by each depending on the scale setting (yes/no) for the item.
    A quantity minimum must have items associated with it.
    Quantity is the one of the more flexible minimum types;
    it works with every discount type except <i>scaling discount (department)</i>
    <li><b>Department</b> (D, D+) requires a minimum total purchase across the selected departments.
Purchase is measured in dollars rather than quantity. Applicable discount types are
<i>scaling discount (department)</i>, <i>flat discount</i>, and <i>percent discount</i>.
    <li><b>Mixed</b> (M) is the most complicated minimum type (yet). The customer must purchase
at least the specified quantity of <i>qualifying</i> items and some quantity of <i>discount</i>
items. Mixed discount is the only case where an item's QUALIFIER/DISCOUNT/BOTH setting
should be used. Like quantity discount, mixed discount can be used with any discount
type except <i>scaling discount (department)</i>
    <li><b>Total</b> ($, $+) discount simply refers to the total of the entire transaction in
dollars. No specific items or departments are associated with this minimum. The only
applicable discount types are <i>flat discount</i> and <i>percent discount</i>
    <li><b>No minimum</b> (blank) is exactly what it sounds like.
</ul>

<h3>Discount types</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Q Quantity</b> discount gives a certain number of items free. Fractions are OK, so
this ends up being like a percent discount. A value of 1.0 gives an item for free, a value of
0.5 gives an item for 50% off, etc. The discount is always applied to the cheapest valid item.
<li><b>P Set Price</b> discount locks in the coupon price. Regardless of the regular price, the 
price with coupon will be exactly what's specified here.
<li><b>FI Flat (Scaling) Discount (Item)</b> discounts the chepeast applicable item by the specified amount.
This scales with quantity to deal with by-weight items.
<li><b>FD Flat (Scaling) Discount (Department)</b> is the same as above except for an item in the specified
department(s) instead of a specific UPC
<li><b>F Flat Discount</b> removes exactly the given amount, once, from the transaction
<li><b>Per-Item Discount</b> removes the discount amount times the number of matching items.</li>
<li><b>Percent Discounts</b> provide a percentage off all discountable items (e.g., member 
appreciation month):
    <ul>
        <li><b>%</b> <i>End of transaction</i> must be applied at the end of the transaction.</li>
        <li><b>%D</b> <i>Department</i> applies only to items in the chosen department(s)</li>
        <li><b>PD</b> <i>Anytime</i> can be entered at anytime but may interact with member's percent
        discount in unexpected ways depending what order everything occurs.</li>
        <li><b>%C</b> <i>Capped</i> discount is limited to the first $X of the transaction.
        Example: For 5% off the first $50 enter 50.05, i.e. Cap-Amount.Percent-Discount. 
    </ul>
<li><b>AD All Discount (Department)</b> ?For a Department.
</ul>
