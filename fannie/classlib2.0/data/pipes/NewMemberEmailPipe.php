/**
  @class NewMemberEmailPipe

  This is a PHP script designed to receive emails.
  Postfix (and perhaps other MTAs) can deliver a message
  to a program rathan than a mailbox. This script is
  meant to receive those kind of piped messages.

  The main idea is to provide a pathway for a host on
  the general internet to send a message to Fannie
  without allowing access to HTTP/HTTPS/MySQL. There
  are validation/authentication concerns no matter 
  what the mechanism, but I think this approach 
  has some advantages in terms of keeping responses
  to external inputs tailored really, really narrowly.
  It does add "mail server admin" to the list of hats
  the IT staff has to wear though.

  The initial usage I have in mind is signing up
  members via the co-op's website. When someone signs
  up on the site, the website would send an email to
  the store with their information encoded somehow
  (JSON, probably) and then this script could use
  that information to update the database. Using a
  mysql driver that supports prepared statements 
  properly would be highly recommended since this
  increases the danger of malicious input a fair amount.

  For validation, I think I'll prepopuldate a set
  of member accounts on the POS side with some kind
  of random hexadecimal key on each account (likely
  via custdata.blueLine) and push them out to the 
  website. The incoming member signup messages could
  then be required to provide the correct hex key
  for the account they are creating. Headers could
  be validated, too (From, originating server, etc)
  but since it's all spoofable I don't know if it's
  even worth bothering.

  Prepopulating accounts on the website does open
  the possibility that new memberships could 
  become "out of stock" which is rather silly, but
  that should be fairly simple to avoid with a 
  generous initial allocation and then fine-tuning
  based on results. It would eliminate most of the
  risk of accidentally giving out the same number
  twice if one customer is signing up in the store
  while another is signing up online.

    I highly doubt this is 100% RFC2822 compliant.
    Shouldn't matter for use cases I'm considering,

    means my validation says it isn't a correctly
